                        WELCOME to the FRIDAY FUND! 

# Overview

Friday Fund is a comprehensive web application developed to showcase proficiency in various aspects of web development, specifically focusing on models, relationships, validations, routes, and RESTful API implementation. This project serves as a culmination of skills learned and practiced during the development phase.

The application aims to streamline financial management and investment tracking for users, providing intuitive tools and functionalities to facilitate informed decision-making regarding their funds. App users are privy to creating their own goals, and being able to add/move money consistently to reach those goals. This is saving made simple!

# Deliverables Met

-->  Backend Requirements:

Models, Relationships, and Validations: The backend incorporates three models representing key entities within the application, establishing two one-to-many relationships and one reciprocal many-to-many relationship. String and number format validations are implemented to ensure data integrity.

CRUD Operations: 
Full CRUD operations are implemented for at least one resource, with minimum functionalities for create and read operations provided for each model.

Forms and Validation:
We utilized Formik and Yup, forms are integrated into the frontend for user interaction, ensuring proper validation of user inputs before submission.

--> Frontend Requirements:

Client-side Routes:
Three client-side routes are implemented to navigate through different sections of the application, enhancing user experience and accessibility.

Fetch API Integration:
The Fetch API is utilized to connect the frontend with the backend, enabling seamless data retrieval and interaction.

# Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. cd into the root directory of ' kpkr-phase-4-project '
3. Install backend dependencies by running :

      $ pipenv install
      $ pipenv shell
      Run your Flask API on localhost:5555:

      $ python server/app.py
      Check that your server serves the default route http://localhost:5555.

4. Install frontend dependencies:

$ npm install 
--> The React app runs on localhost:3000:

$ npm start 
--> Check that your React client displays a default page http://localhost:3000.

5. Start the server using "npm start".
